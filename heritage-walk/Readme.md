This was for coursework; the assessment was to create/pitch a heritage walk through the Mardyke area in Cork city, Ireland. The map shows amenities (cafes, bus stops, etc) so that people wanting to do the walk know how to get there. It has the start and end marked, and numbered stops. The numbers etc were then referenced in my pitch (not included here). I created several shape files in QGIS to create the shape files, and loaded them into an R script, using OpenStreetMaps as base map.
